### 从句

#### 从句的原理

**一个句子充当另一个句子的成分**

如: 我看见了兔子正在吃胡萝卜

- 主语 -- 我
- 谓语 -- 看见
- 宾语 -- 兔子正在吃胡萝卜 (但是这个宾语也是一个简单句,所以称这个为从句)

英语中句子的类型

- 简单句
- 复合句/并列句 (由连词合在一起的简单句)
- 复杂句 (一个主句,一个从句)

除了**谓语**,句子的所有成分都可以充当从句

- 主语从句
- 宾语从句
- 宾语补语从句
- 表语从句
- 定语从句
- 状语从句
- 同位语从句

也可以按词性给从句分类

- 名词从句 = 主语从句 / 宾语从句 / 宾语补语从句 / 表语从句 / 同位语从句
- 形容词从句 = 定语从句 / 关系从句
- 副词从句 = 状语从句
    - 时间副词从句
    - 地点副词从句
    - ......

#### 形容词从句 / 定语从句 / 关系从句

形容词从句的主要功能是限定名词的范围

**定语**从句的引导词 that 也可以省略
当先行词为 `the way` 时,可以省略 `that`
当先行词为 `reason` 时,可以省略 `why`
当先行词为 `time` 时,可以省略 `when`

the rabbit eating a carrot **that** I bought 
that 是关系词, carrot 是先行词, that I bought 是个定语从句,作为修饰 carrot 的定语

1. 一根**好吃的**胡萝卜
    - a **tasty** carrot
2. 一个**兔子吃了的**胡萝卜
    - a carrot **that the rabbit ate**
3. 一个**是兔子的**老师
    - a teacher **who is a rabbit**
4. 一个**我昨天看见了的**老师
    - a teacher **whom I saw yesterday**
5. 兔子**吃胡萝卜的地方**
    - the place **where the rabbit ate the carrot**
6. 兔子**吃胡萝卜的原因**
    - the reason **why the rabbit ate the carrot**

以上可以看出形容词从句都是后置的
从句中的关系代词和关系副词 统称关系词

##### 关系代词

- that -- the rabbit is eating a carrot **that I bought** (兔子在吃我买来的胡萝卜)
- who -- the teacher **who ate a carrot** is a rabbit (吃胡萝卜的兔子老师)
- whom -- the teacher **whom I saw yesterday** is a rabbit (我昨天看见的兔子老师)
- whose -- the teacher **whose favorite food is carrot** is a rabbit (最喜欢的食物是胡萝卜的兔子老师)
- which -- the food **which the teacher likes** is a carrot (老师喜欢的的食物是胡萝卜)

which 和 that 可以互换
先行词是唯一的使用 that, 先行词是多选一的使用 which
还有一种说法是 指人的用 that, 指物的用 which

陈述句 -> 包含关系代词的陈述句 -> 变为从句

| 陈述句 | 包含关系代词的陈述句 | 变为从句 |
| ----------------------- | ---- | ---- |
|            I bought **the carrot**             | I bought **that** | **that** I bought |
| **the teacher** ate a carrot | **who** ate a carrot | **who** ate a carrot |
| I saw **the teacher** yesterday | I saw **whom** yesterday | **whom** I saw yesterday |
| **the teacher** favorite food is carrot | **whose** favorite food is carrot | **whose** favorite food is carrot |
| the teacher likes **the food** | the teacher likes **which** | **which** the teacher likes |

##### 关系副词

关系副词相当于 **介词 + which**

* where -- this was the place **where the rabbit ate the carrot**
    * the rabbit ate the carrot 修改为缺成分的句子为 the rabbit ate the carrot at **[ the place]**
    * 缺成分就不能使用副词了, 就使用代词, which
    * 但是一个 which 又表达不出在特定的地点的感觉, 所以使用 at which 
    * this was the place **at which the rabbit ate the carrot**

* why -- this is the reason **why the rabbit ate the carrot**
    * 修改为 the rabbit ate the carrot for **[the reason]**
    * 缺成分,使用 which

* when -- that was the day **when the rabbit ate the carrot**

| 关系副词                                               | 转换为关系代词                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| this was the place **where the rabbit ate the carrot** | this was the place **at which the rabbit ate the carrot**  |
| this is the reason **why the rabbit ate the carrot**   | this is the reason **for which the rabbit ate the carrot** |
| that was the day **when the rabbit ate the carrot**    | that was the day **on which the rabbit ate the carrot**    |

##### 关系形容词 whose

whose = of which / of whom

- I like girls **whose** eyes are big
    - 正常情况下,从句完整,不能使用关系代词,使用关系形容词 whose 表示什么的
    - I like girls ,the girls' eyes are big
    - 但是还可以使用 of 所有格表示
    - I like girls ,the eyes of the girls are big
    - 这样就可以使用 of whom 
    - I like girls **of whom** the eyes are big
- I like books whose contents are interest
    - 正常情况下,从句完整,不能使用关系代词,使用关系形容词 whose 表示什么的
    - I like books ,the books' contents are interest
    - 使用 of 所有格表示
    - I like books ,the contents of the books are interest
    - 这样就可以使用 of which
    - I like books **of which** the books are interest

##### 非限定性形容词从句

本质: **主句一般是唯一的,从句就是补充说明**

- 非限定性关系代词: which / who / whom / as , 如果代整个句子的话,只能用 which / as 
- 非限定性关系副词: when / where / 介词+which
- 非限定性关系形容词: whose / of+which / of+whom 
- 根据句子意思来使用代词
    - which 这件事
        - they found the murder, which surprised me
    - as 正如
        - as we all know, the earth is round
- 根据位置来使用代词
    - which 放在主句后面
    - as 任意
- 根据时间来使用代词
    - which 分先后
    - as 表示事实

I have a head, which is round -- which  = head

the rabbit ate the carrot, which was on the table -- which = the carrot

my head, which is big, is useful when is rains

the biggest carrot, which the rabbit ate, was on the table

the rabbit ate the carrot, which is not surprising -- which == the rabbit ate the carrot

##### 如何选择合适的引导词

1. 如果从句中缺成分,则使用关系代词 (that / which / who / whom / whose)
    1. 及物动词缺宾语
    2. 介词后面缺宾语
    3. 双及物动词缺直宾
    4. 缺主语
2. 不缺则使用关系副词 (where / when / why)
    1. 需要注意被动即完整 -- this is the party where **the party was held** -- was held 表示被动
    2. 间接宾语除外 -- this is the reason that I was told -- told 是双及物动词, told 什么人,什么事,这里缺了直接宾语,所以不能使用 why
3. 关系代词做宾语可以省略
    - this is the place [that] we visited last time
    - I know the man [that] you just talked with

##### 主谓一致

看关系代词代的先行词是单数还是复数

- I have an apple that **is** red -- that 的先行词是 an apple , 是单数形式, 所以谓语动词需要使用单数 is
- I have apples that **are** red -- that 的先行词是 apples , 是复数形式, 所以谓语动词需要使用复数 are

#### 名词从句 / 主语从句/宾语从句/表语从句/宾语补语从句(不常用)/同位语从句

- 连接代词, 名词词性, 在从句中做主宾表
    - what / which / who / whom / where
    - whatever / whichever / whoever / whomever
- 连接副词, 副词词性, 在从句中做状语
    - when / how / why / where / whether(是否)
    - whenever / however / wherever
- 连接形容词, 形容词词性, 在从句中作定语
    - what / which / whose
    - whatever / whichever / whosever
- 狭义连接词
    - that

1. 如果主句是缺成分的,则可以断定从句是名词性从句
2. 如果判断从句是名词性从句,则判断从句是否缺少成分
    1. 如果从句缺成分-使用连接代词(名词性)
    2. 如果从句不缺成分-使用连接副词 / 连接形容词 / 狭义连接词 

简单句 the fact is obvious

##### 主语从句

句子主语成分由主语从句充当

引导词 **whether / where / when / how / who / what** (也称连接代词/副词)

**That the rabbit ate a carrot** is obvious

主语从句在开头

| 中文                         | 翻译 | 形式主语 |
| ---------------------------- | ---- | ---- |
| 兔子是否吃了胡萝卜是明显的   | **whether the rabbit ate the carrot** is obvious | it is obvious **whether the rabbit ate the carrot** |
| 兔子哪里吃的胡萝卜是明显的   | **where the rabbit ate the carrot** is obvious | it is obvious **where the rabbit ate the carrot** |
| 兔子什么时候吃的胡萝卜是明显的 | **when the rabbit ate the carrot** is obvious | it is obvious **when the rabbit ate the carrot** |
| 兔子怎么样吃的胡萝卜是明显的 | **how the rabbit ate the carrot** is obvious | it is obvious **how the rabbit ate the carrot** |
| 谁吃了胡萝卜是明显的 | **who ate the carrot** is obvious | it is obvious **who ate the carrot** |
| 兔子吃了什么是明显的 | **what the rabbit ate** is obvious | it is obvious **what the rabbit ate** |

形式主语(主语在后面)

**that the rabbit ate a carrot** is obvious 替换为形式主语 **It** is obvious **that the rabbit ate a carrot**

* It is secret that the rabbit ate a carrot
* It happened that the rabbit ate a carrot

##### 宾语从句

**如何判断是不是宾语从句**

1. 看及物动词后面是否缺宾语
2. 看介词后面是否缺宾语
3. 看双及物动词后面是否缺宾语补足语

确定信息充当宾语从句

I saw **that the rabbit ate a carrot**

不确定的信息充当宾语从句

| 中文                         | 翻译                                        |      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| 我看看兔子是否吃了胡萝卜     | I saw **whether the rabbit ate the carrot** |      |
| 我看看兔子哪里吃的胡萝卜     | I saw **where the rabbit ate the carrot**   |      |
| 我看看兔子什么时候吃的胡萝卜 | I saw **when the rabbit ate the carrot**    |      |
| 我看看兔子怎么样吃的胡萝卜   | I saw **how the rabbit ate the carrot**     |      |
| 我看看谁吃了胡萝卜           | I saw **who ate the carrot**                |      |
| 我看看兔子吃了什么           | I saw **what the rabbit ate**               |      |

当看到 whether / where / when / how / who / what 不一定是包含了疑问代词的问句,然后错误加上助动词 dose

**宾语**从句的第一个引导词 that 往往可以省略如 :

- I know [that] the rabbit ate the carrot
- I think [that] the rabbit is smart
- I believe [that] I will get rich
- I expect [that] you will give me some coin

否定加在谓语动词前面,而不是宾语从句中

- I do not think [that] you are smart
- I don't believe [that] you will give me a coin
- I don't expect [that] you will give me a coin

主句时态需要和从句时态保持一致

- I didn't think [that] you ~~are~~ right -> I didn't think [that] you were right
- I knew [that] the rabbit ~~like~~ carrot -> I knew [that] the rabbit liked carrot
- I knew [that] sum **rises** in the east -- 描述客观的东西,则不需要保持一致

##### 表语从句

be 动词

- the problem is **that the rabbit is hungry**
- the reason is **that there's no more carrot**
- the question is **whether the rabbit is angry**
- the question is **what the rabbit should eat**
- the question is **where/when/how the rabbit should eat the carrot**

非 be 动词

- It seems that the rabbit is hungry 
- It feels that you are not telling the truth

##### 同位语从句

同位语就是用同样的方式,把一个概念以不同的方式再说一遍,用逗号隔开 如:

- **my wife**, **a beautiful girl**, likes angry -- **my wife**, **a beautiful girl** 指的是同一个概念, a beautiful girl 是主语的同位语
- I love **my wife**, **a beautiful girl** -- a beautiful girl 是宾语 my wife 的同位语

当一个从句充当同位语时,这个从句就叫做同位语从句,这样的从句常在句子中修饰抽象的名词

- the fact **that the rabbit ate the carrot** did not surprise me -- 因为用了引导词,所以不需要逗号隔开
- the question **that whether the rabbit will eat the carrot** is on all our minds
- I have no idea **who ate the carrot** 
- I am sure **that there's a carrot on the table**

##### 宾语补语从句

简单句 you can call me

修改为宾语补语从句 you can call me **what you like** 

- my education made me who I am today

#### 状语从句/副词从句

状语从句,主句和从句都是完整的
从句修饰主句中的动词

主将从现, 在状语从句中, 主语使用将来时表将来, 从句使用现在时表将来

##### 表时间 (在...之前)

时间副词从句

- 在某个时间点之前,引导词使用 **before**
    - the rabbit ate a carrot at home **before the wolf stopped by** (从句在后) (狼来串门之前,兔子在家吃了根胡萝卜) 
    - **before the wolf stopped by**, the rabbit ate a carrot at home (从句在前,需要加逗号)
    
- 在某个时间点之中,引导词使用 **when / while / as** 
    - the rabbit was eating carrot **when I went home** -- when 表示一个时间点
        - be about to do 使用 when
        - be doing 使用 when
        - have just done 使用 when
    - the rabbit was eating carrot **while I was watching TV** -- while 表示一段时间内
    - I ate the carrot **as I made the video** -- as 表示同时进行两个动作
        - as time goes by , it gets colder and colder -- as 也可以表示随着 
    
- 在某个时间点之后,引导词使用 **after**
    - the rabbit ate a carrot **after the wolf stopped by** 

- 自从某个时间点之后 **since**
    - the rabbit has shared three carrots **since the wolf stopped by**
    - the rabbit has not stopped sharing carrots **since the wolf stopped by**
    
- 直到某个时间点为止 **until** / till (两者没区别,书面使用 untill, 口语使用 till ) , **not...untill** 指之前做不到,直到某个时刻才可以做到
    - the rabbit waited **until the wolf stopped by**
    - the rabbit didn't eat any carrot **until the wolf stopped by**

- 一个动词紧跟一个动作发生 **as soon as**
    no sooner...than...
    hardly...when/before
    as soon as
    the moment
    the second
    the instant
    
    immediately
    instantly
    directly

##### 表条件 (如果...)

条件副词从句,就是常说的条件句 **If**

- 如果 **if**
    - **if** the rabbit sees a carrot, he will eat it （~~主句使用将来时，从句使用现在时~~,这是错误的总结）
    - the rabbit will eat the carrot, **if** he sees it （主句使用一般现在时态表示客观事实，加上 if 表示不确定的客观事实， 所以不能用时间来表示，但是如果这个条件成立，从句一定会明确的做出动作）

- 除非 **unless**
    - **unless** you like this video, you will not give it some reward

- 假如 **provided** [that]
    - **provided** that my video is good, you will give it some reward

- 只要 **as long as** / so long as

- smart -> smarter
- beautiful -> more beautiful

例句:

- he is smarter **than** me
- this carrot is bigger **than** that one 
- she is **as** beautiful **as** snow white

以上的句子只能算省略句,完整句子如下

- he is smarter than I am
- this carrot is bigger than that one is
