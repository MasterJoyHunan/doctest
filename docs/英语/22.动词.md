### 动词分类

动词分为三大类,助动词,实义动词,系动词

#### 助动词

助动词起辅助左右,所以不能单独构成谓语

##### be动词

be + doing 表进行 
be + done 表被动

- is, am, are
- 过去式 was were
- 原型 be

##### 情态动词

情态动词后面 + do

情态动词有几个特点

##### 狭义助动词

狭义助动词 + do

狭义助动词 + 实义动词, 表示强调

- do -- 原型
- does -- 第三人称单数

##### 完成助动词

用于帮助构成完成时态,后面需要加 done

- have
- has
- had

#### 实义动词 (行为动词)

##### 及物动词 `vt`

及物动词后面**必须要加宾语**, 从而构成主谓宾结构 

##### 不及物动词 `vi`

#### be 助动词和系动词的区别

##### be 作为助动词

**be动词 + doing 构成进行**

**be动词 + done 构成被动**
She is killed

##### be 作为系动词

She is a pig

#### 助动词 + 实义动词

- you can help me
- you may keep the book for two week
- he has caught a bad cold
- my sister is crying over there
- I have been waiting for you all the time
- I would stay at home all day

#### 助动词 + 系动词

- he is being a student
- he can be a student
- he dose be a student
- he has been a student 

#### 复合谓语公式

情态动词 + 完成助动词 + be 动词 + 实义动词 + 介词
would         have                been       looking       for

- 实义动词 look 是不及物动词,所以后面需要加介词 -- look for
- look 前面加 is 构成进行时态, is 后面需要加 doing 形式 -- 所以成了 is looking for
- 变成完成形式 需要在前面加上 have , have 后面需要接 done 形式 -- 变成了完成进行时 have been looking for
- 加个情态动词 需要在前面加上 would -- 变成了过去将来完成进行时 would have been looking for

#### [be]助动词构成时态

- the boy is crying -- 一般进行时
- he has arrived -- 一般完成时
- I have been painting all day -- 一般完成进行时

#### 助动词构成否定句和疑问句

- Dose he like English? -- 构成疑问
- He doesn't have lunch at home -- 构成否定

#### 助动词构成被动语态

- trees are planted in spring
- the house has been pulled down -- has 构成完成 been 构成被动

#### 助动词构成虚拟语气

- If he had come yesterday, I wouldn't have made such a mistake

#### 助动词构成倒装

- so much did he love his mother that he bought her many presents on her birthday

#### 助动词构成强调

- he did come yesterday
